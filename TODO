BUGS

  epoll() can't handle adding the same file descriptor more than once.
  should the epoll() backend pretend that the file descriptor was added?
  all the other interfaces seem to allow this, however useless it might
  be.

TEST

  what happens if io_poll_rm(iop, iop->len)? --iop->len?

  scatter test of reading, writing and closing of/to multiple fds to
  ensure all data is up to date at all times.
