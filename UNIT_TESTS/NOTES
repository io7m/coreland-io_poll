On many operating systems, it is necessary to raise the default
file descriptor limit for all tests to pass. Some of the tests
require very large numbers of file descriptors (specifically,
FD_SETSIZE * 2).

  Darwin:
    ulimit -n 8192

  OpenBSD:
    sysctl -w kern.maxfiles 8192

  Linux:
    Edit /etc/security/limits.conf
